# Module 7: Project 1

Project 1: Game Search

## Overview/Description

Welcome to Project 1! Project 1 explains the skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch. With our team, we have conceived and executed a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Working collaboratively, we have created agile development methodologies and implementations that are shown throughout our git branch workflow and pull requests. Project 1 is an API server-side search engine that lists a series of games and genres from the website Giant Bomb. https://www.giantbomb.com/api/documentation/#toc-0-17 Giant Bombs' free video game database and API contains all the storage of what our user selects corresponding to what game and genre they search through our Game Search engine website. Once a game is selected if the Giant Bomb database and API contain the game, the user will be shown Game Title Names, Review Score, Author, Quotes, and Date Published for the user-selected game. On top of that, the user can select specific genres of games they are looking for with genres such as Action, Driving/Racing, FIghting, MMORPG, Platform, Role-Playing, Shooter, Sports, Strategy, and Trivia/Board Game.
